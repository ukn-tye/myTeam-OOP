# My Team Profile Printer
In this project I created a node application that prints out an HTML page with your teams profile on it. The ``Terminal`` will give you the option to choose through three differnet team positions and based off which one you choose it will display some question that you will answer. Once you have finished your profile, it will give you the option to add a new profile or to go ahead and print it. Once you print, it will generate an ``HTML`` page that already has some base code and css styling with your content displayed within it.

## Installation
* ``git clone`` the repository
* Open a Node terminal and run the command ``npm install`` to install required packages
* Run the command ``node index.js`` to initiate the card generator
* Your ``test.html`` file should be created after all prompts are filled out

## What it looks like
Here's an image of what the profiles will look like
